### A Simple Framework for Designing for Behavior

**Draft Outline:**
The MAPS Framework for Behavior Design
- **M**otivation: What drives the user?
- **A**bility: Can they do it easily?
- **P**rompts: What triggers the action?
- **S**ystem: How does context support or hinder?

**Key Reading Materials:**
- "Hooked" by Nir Eyal
- "Nudge" by Thaler & Sunstein
- BJ Fogg's Behavior Model research
- "The Power of Moments" by Chip & Dan Heath
- Don Norman's "The Design of Everyday Things"

**LinkedIn Experts to Contact:**
- BJ Fogg (Stanford Behavior Lab)
- Nir Eyal (behavior design author)
- Julie Zhuo (design leadership)

**Short Draft:**
Behavior design isn't about manipulation—it's about alignment. The MAPS framework helps designers create experiences that work with human psychology, not against it. Start with Motivation (why would someone want this?), ensure Ability (can they actually do it?), provide clear Prompts (what triggers action?), and design Systems that reinforce rather than undermine the desired behavior. The magic happens when all four elements converge at the right moment.

### Holism Doesn't Mean "Think Big"

**Reading Materials:**
- "Thinking in Systems" by Donella Meadows
- "The Fifth Discipline" by Peter Senge
- "General Systems Theory" by Ludwig von Bertalanffy
- Complex adaptive systems literature
- Network theory fundamentals

**LinkedIn Experts:**
- Peter Senge (MIT, systems thinking)
- Dave Snowden (Cynefin framework)
- Linda Booth Sweeney (systems educator)

**Short Draft:**
Holism isn't about scale—it's about relationships. When we think systemically, we're not trying to include everything or zoom out to the highest level. We're following the flows. We're tracing how A influences B, which shapes C, which loops back to A. The devil lives in these details: the specific feedback loops, the particular constraints, the actual mechanisms of influence. True systems thinking gives you permission to dive deep into the machinery of causation, wherever that trail leads.

### Tools for Early-Stage Systemic Design

**Reading Materials:**
- "Universal Methods of Design" by Martin & Hanington
- "Service Design Tools" by Tassi
- "The Art of Problem Solving" by Russell Ackoff
- Design thinking methodologies
- Systems mapping techniques

**LinkedIn Experts:**
- Indi Young (systems research)
- Andy Polaine (service design)
- Marc Stickdorn (service design thinking)

**Short Draft:**
Three tools every systemic designer needs: Stakeholder mapping (who's affected?), Journey mapping (what's the experience flow?), and Force field analysis (what helps/hinders?). Start messy, iterate quickly, and always ask "what ripple effects am I missing?" The goal isn't perfect diagrams—it's better questions and clearer thinking about the system you're designing within.

## Modeling

### How Cities Are Governed in America

**Reading Materials:**
- "City Politics" by Dennis Judd & Todd Swanstrom
- "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" by Jane Jacobs
- Municipal government structure resources
- Brookings Institution urban policy reports
- National League of Cities governance guides

**LinkedIn Experts:**
- Bruce Katz (Brookings Metro)
- Jennifer Bradley (urban policy)
- Amanda Burden (urban planning)

**Model Draft:**
A simple systems diagram showing: Federal mandates/funding → State laws/regulations → County coordination → City Council (elected) → Mayor (executive) → Department heads → Street-level bureaucrats → Citizens. Include feedback loops: voting, public meetings, protests, and informal influence networks. Key insight: power flows in multiple directions, not just top-down.

### Learning Civics: A Knowledge Landscape

**Reading Materials:**
- "Bowling Alone" by Robert Putnam
- "The Righteous Mind" by Jonathan Haidt
- Civics education curricula analysis
- "Democracy in One Book or Less" by David Litt
- iCivics educational resources

**LinkedIn Experts:**
- Sandy Levinson (constitutional law)
- Danielle Allen (civic education)
- Eric Liu (Citizen University)

**Model Draft:**
Map showing interconnected domains: Constitutional Framework (structure) → Political Processes (elections, legislation) → Civic Participation (voting, activism) → Policy Outcomes (laws, services) → Social Impact (community health). Include skills needed at each level: critical thinking, media literacy, negotiation, systems analysis.

### Obscure American Political Ideologies (Systems View)

**Reading Materials:**
- "The Reactionary Mind" by Corey Robin
- American political thought anthologies
- Ideological spectrum beyond left/right
- "The Political Brain" by Drew Westen
- Third-party and fringe movement documentation

**LinkedIn Experts:**
- Matt Grossmann (political science)
- Lee Drutman (political reform)
- Rachel Bitecofer (political behavior)

**Model Draft:**
Systems map showing ideologies as coherent worldviews with internal logic: Georgism (land value capture), Distributism (local ownership), Technocracy (expert rule), Bioregionalism (ecological governance). Map their assumptions about human nature, government role, and change mechanisms. Show how each creates different feedback loops in society.

### Three Cybernetic Models for American Power

**Reading Materials:**
- "Cybernetics" by Norbert Wiener
- "The Brain of the Firm" by Stafford Beer
- "Cybernetics and Society" by Norbert Wiener
- "Platform Revolution" by Parker, Van Alstyne & Choudary
- Network power analysis literature

**LinkedIn Experts:**
- Yochai Benkler (network society)
- Zeynep Tufekci (technology and society)
- danah boyd (social media systems)

**Model Draft:**
1. **Viable System Model**: American government as nested autonomous systems with feedback loops
2. **Network Effects Model**: How information and influence flow through social/digital networks
3. **Homeostatic Control**: How power systems self-regulate and resist change through feedback mechanisms

Each model reveals different leverage points for understanding and potentially influencing American power structures.
