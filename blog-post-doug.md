# Some Things Stay the Same

## Systemic Themes

In a world of constant change, certain fundamentals remain consistent. This blog post explores the enduring nature of identity and purpose - the things that anchor us even as everything around us transforms.

**Core Themes:**
- **Persistence of Identity**: Our sense of self remains constant even as circumstances shift
- **The Search for Purpose**: The fundamental question "What do I do?" reflects our ongoing quest for meaning
- **Stability in Change**: Finding the elements that endure through transformation

## Examples of How to Use These Themes to Build Something

These systemic themes can be applied in various practical ways:

1. **Personal Branding**: Like "My name is Doug" - establish a consistent identity across all platforms and communications. Your name and core values should remain constant even as your work evolves.

2. **Mission Statements**: Answer "What do I do?" clearly and concisely. Build your projects around this core purpose:
   - Create an elevator pitch that captures your essence
   - Design products/services that align with your fundamental purpose
   - Develop content that reinforces your core identity

3. **Building Resilient Systems**: Design systems with stable core principles while allowing flexibility in execution:
   - Establish unchanging values as your foundation
   - Create frameworks that can adapt while maintaining core integrity
   - Document what stays constant vs. what can evolve
